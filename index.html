        <H3>Letâ€™s Get Rocked</H3><br>
        <hr><br>
        <p> <strong>Lyrics:</strong><br><br> Do ya wanna get rocked?
          Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get
          Rocked...</p><br>
        <p>I'm your average, ordinary everyday kid
          Happy to do nothin', in fact that's what I did
          I got a million ways to make my day, but daddy don't agree
          When I try to get away he says he got plans for me</p><br>
          <p>Get your butt right out of bed, stop buggin' me
            Get up and move your sleepy head, don't shake my tree
            He said:
            Mow the lawn! Who, me?
            Walk the dog! Not my style, man!
            Take out the trash! No way!
            Tidy your room! C'mon, get real!
            Sorry dad, gotta disappear
            Let's get the rock outta here</p><br>
          <p>Seven-day weekend, up all night
            In at the deep end, hang on tight
            Won't take a minute, it won't take long
            So get on in it, come on, come on, come on</p><br>
          <p>Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
            Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
            Let's go all the way, get it night 'n' day
            C'mon, let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked</p><br>
          <p>I'm your average, ordinary everyday dude
            Drivin' with my baby to get her in the mood
            She's dialin' through my radio, waiting to make my move
            But what she got ain't rock 'n' roll and it really blew my groove</p><br>
          <p>It was Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven
            It makes me wanna scream!
            Bach, Tchaikovsky violins
            Turn it off! That ain't my scene
            Well, I'm sorry girl, here's my confession
            I suppose a rock's out of the question?</p><br>
          <p>Seven-day weekend, up all night
            In at the deep end, hang on tight
            It won't take a minute, it won't take long
            So get on in it, come on, come on, come on!
            Sing it!</p><br>
          <p>Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
            Come on!
            Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
            Let's go all the way, get it night 'n' day
            Come on, let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked</p><br>
          <p>All I wanna do is take a ride into the blue
            Every time I want to love you
            I get stuck inside my room
            Heaven knows I'm sick 'n' tired of dancin' with this broom</p><br>
          <p>I feel lucky today
            Hey, look at that, oh yeah
            Do you wanna get rocked?
            Do you wanna get rocked?</p><br>
          <p>It won't take you a minute
            It won't take that long
            So get on, get with it
            Oh, come on, everybody!</p><br>
          <p>Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
            A litle bit louder
            Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
            Do you wanna, do you wanna?
            Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
            Get on top of it
            Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
            Love to rock your body, baby
            Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked</p><br>
          <p>Let's go all the way
            Let's do it night 'n' day
            Let's get out and play
            Rock the night away
            Come on, let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get...
            Do you wanna get rocked?</p><br>
