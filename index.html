        <div class="lyrics">
          <p>Do ya wanna get rocked?
            Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get
            Rocked...</p><br>
          <p>I'm your average, ordinary everyday kid
            Happy to do nothin', in fact that's what I did
            I got a million ways to make my day, but daddy don't agree
            When I try to get away he says he got plans for me</p><br>
          <p>Get your butt right out of bed, stop buggin' me
            Get up and move your sleepy head, don't shake my tree
            He said:
            Mow the lawn! Who, me?
            Walk the dog! Not my style, man!
            Take out the trash! No way!
            Tidy your room! C'mon, get real!
            Sorry dad, gotta disappear
            Let's get the rock outta here</p><br>
          <p>Seven-day weekend, up all night
            In at the deep end, hang on tight
            Won't take a minute, it won't take long
            So get on in it, come on, come on, come on</p><br>
          <p>Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked

            C'mon, let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked</p><br>
          <p>I'm your average, ordinary everyday dude
            Drivin' with my baby to get her in the mood
            She's dialin' through my radio, waiting to make my move
            But what she got ain't rock 'n' roll and it really blew my groove</p><br>
          <p>It was Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven
            It makes me wanna scream!
            Bach, Tchaikovsky violins
            Turn it off! That ain't my scene
            Well, I'm sorry girl, here's my confession
            I suppose a rock's out of the question?</p><br>
          <p>Seven-day weekend, up all night
            In at the deep end, hang on tight

            Come on, let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked</p><br>
          <p>All I wanna do is take a ride into the blue
            Every time I want to love you
            I get stuck inside my room
            Heaven knows I'm sick 'n' tired of dancin' with this broom</p><br>
          <p>I feel lucky today
            Hey, look at that, oh yeah
            Do you wanna get rocked?
            Do you wanna get rocked?</p><br>
          <p>It won't take you a minute
